## Vary
Vary is the Malagasy word for rice, and rice is the foundation of all three meals in Malagasy cuisine. This project is the
foundation for new SFML games. With no work it gives you a UI, map loader for Tiled, camera, character sprite, and directional
movement. The UI includes a menu to rebinding the keyboard and mouse.

## Motivation
Get your next prototype up and running fast. Also, great for beginners, who can look under the hood without a lot of complexity.

## Usage
First you will need to clone the Vary and Trambo repositories. These two directories must live next to each other. The library
files for SFML 2.1 and the source files for TinyXML-2 are already included for you. Now compile Trambo with Visual
Studio 2013 followed by Vary. Note: Visual Studio 2015, VC14 broke the C Runtime, so the C external libraries need to be
recompiled. Either use Visual Studio 2013 or use a newer verion of SFML 2.1
